# Spotify_Clustering
Use Clustering on Playlists based on Track Analysis Data

Selected best clustering model to describe 70,000 playlists with 30 clusters resulting in sensible clusters.

Cluster centers were used to identify nearest neighbors for each cluster. Analysis of these clusters shows that the clustering is working.

K-nearest neighbors was used to recommend similar playlists, artists, and songs
